# Create a new stage for running the application that contains the minimal

# image from the build stage where the necessary files are copied from the build
# stage.

# The example below uses the alpine image as the foundation for running the app.
# By specifying the "3.18" tag, it will use version 3.18 of alpine. If
# reproducibility is important, consider using a digest
# (e.g., alpine@sha256:664888ac9cfd28068e062c991ebcff4b4c7307dc8dd4df9e728bedde5c449d91).

# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: final
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
